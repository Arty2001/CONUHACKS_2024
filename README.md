<h1> <b> Project Description </b> </h1>

Empowering financial education, our web application for SunLife Clients elegantly combines personalized data inputs with intelligent algorithms, serving as a visionary guide through the labyrinth of personal finances, empowering users to proactively navigate inflation's impact and achieve unparalleled financial success. Our web application is not just a financial tool; it’s a financial companion. It offers foresight into the future, helping SunLife Clients prepare for the impact of inflation on their unique financial journeys. We believe that by empowering individuals with this knowledge, we’re not just addressing challenges, but we’re paving the way for financial resilience and success.

Our platform enables users to track the growth of their net worth over time by considering factors such as income, assets, expenses, and investment goals. The backend processes this data to compute the user's post-tax income, and an interactive interface showcases the trajectory of their investments. The system takes into account all prevalent investment accounts in Canada, strategically allocating funds according to the user's personalized financial objectives.
